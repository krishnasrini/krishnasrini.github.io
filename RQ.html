  <b> To pursue or not to pursue a research question?</b>
  </p>
      
  <p>
    I hope this checklist will help you decide whether you should pursue a research question or not. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I came up with this checklist by collecting people's feedback when they shot down a number of my research ideas (and I thank them for it!). 
    Of course, not all of the checkboxes need to be checked for you to pursue a research question.
    Feel free to email me if you think something belongs on this list.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b> Contribution </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <input type="checkbox">  Is this the broadest question that you should be answering? <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Is this a first-order question in the broader topic?  (Would a handbook chapter on the broader topic include your paper?) <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Are you exploring the first-order mechanism/factor that explains the outcome? <br>
    
    <input type="checkbox">  Is there a (policy) debate/disagreement regarding the answer? <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Does everyone think they know the answer despite no evidence? <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Have some important philosophers and economists been discussing the question? <br>

    <input type="checkbox">  Does the answer have consequences for policymakers/companies/individuals/firms? <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Do you develop novel/important experimental/econometric methods?  <br>

  </p>
  <p>
    <b> Contribution to the literature </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <input type="checkbox">  Has this question been answered before?  <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Is there a partial answer to the question?  <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Has a broader question been answered before?   <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Has a narrower question been answered before?   <br>  
    <input type="checkbox">  Has another mechanism/factor explaining the outcome been explored before?   <br>  

  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Accounting for opportunity costs</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <input type="checkbox">  Did you reframe the question and find a better framing? <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Is there a related question that might be worth pursuing? <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Is this project the best use of my limited research funds?   <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Is this project the best use of my limited time?   <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b> Contribution to self</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <input type="checkbox">  Is this question interesting to me? <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Would I enjoy working on this project? <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Do I have the skills to answer this? (e.g., math/experiment/coding skills) <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Would this project help me learn a new skill or be exposed to new fields? <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Can I publish this project in a journal that my department/field values?   <br>
  </p>

  <p>
  <b> Implementation for experiments </b>
  <p>
    <input type="checkbox">  Do you need to run a lab, field, or online experiment?   <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Is the experiment feasible?   <br>
    <input type="checkbox">  Do you have the money to run the experiment?  <br>
  </p>
