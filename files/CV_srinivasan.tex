    ``Who Should Get Money? Estimating Welfare Weights in the U.S." (with Francesco Capozza) 

    Evaluating the desirability of a reform involves weighing the gains of the winners against the losses of the losers using welfare weights. Welfare weights measure the value society places on providing an additional dollar of consumption to individuals. Which welfare weights should be used to evaluate policies? We take a positive approach to answer this question by identifying the welfare weights assigned by the general population of the U.S. using a real-stakes experiment. These weights are general enough to capture various ideals, such as equality of opportunity or poverty alleviation, and can be directly used to evaluate Social Architects' assessment of the desirability of reforms. We find that the average welfare weights of the general population are progressive, indicating a desire for additional redistribution beyond that achieved by the current tax and transfer system. The general population weights are more progressive than the weights implied by the tax and transfer policies in the U.S. but less progressive than the weights frequently used in the optimal policy literature.
