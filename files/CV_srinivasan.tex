    ``Who Should Get Money? Estimating Welfare Weights in the U.S.'' (with Francesco Capozza) 

    Evaluating the desirability of a reform commonly involves weighing the gains of the winners against the losses of the losers using welfare weights. Welfare weights measure the relative social value of providing individuals with an additional dollar of consumption. These weights can capture various normative ideals, such as utilitarianism or libertarianism. We elicit the welfare weights assigned by the general population of the U.S. using a real-stakes experiment. The general population weights can be used to identify socially acceptable policies. We find that the general population weights are more progressive than the weights implied by tax and transfer policies in the U.S., indicating that the general population desires additional redistribution. The general population weights are less progressive than the weights frequently used in the optimal policy literature. We explore the implications of these weights for the optimal income taxes.
