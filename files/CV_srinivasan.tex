\begin{rSection}{SELECTED WORK IN PROGRESS}
  \textbf{``Who Should Get Money? Estimating Welfare Weights in the U.S.,”} with Francesco Capozza
  % Several policy settings such as income taxation, cash transfers, and in-kind transfers, require us to evaluate whether a reform is desirable or not. One way to evaluate reforms on the basis of their distributional consequences is through the use of welfare weights, which measure the value of providing an additional dollar of consumption to any individual in society and thereby capture society's fairness concerns. 
  % In our project, we identify the welfare weights of the general population of the U.S. using an experimental approach. In our experiment, participants in the role of ``Social Architects," assign welfare weights to seven real ``Recipients" with after-tax incomes that span the income distribution of the U.S. Our results suggest that the weights of the general population (i) exhibit a surprisingly low degree of progressivity, (ii) exhibit considerable heterogeneity, (iii) and are very similar to the weights implied by the existing policies in the U.S.
