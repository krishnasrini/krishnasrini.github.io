        <b>Who Should Get Money? Estimating Welfare Weights in the U.S.</b>

        Implementing policy reforms often involves weighing the gains of some individuals in society against the losses of others using welfare weights. Welfare weights measure the relative value society places on providing an additional dollar of consumption to individuals. Which welfare weights should be used to evaluate policies? We take a positive approach to answer this question and identify the welfare weights assigned by the general population of the U.S. using a real-stakes experiment. These weights are general enough to capture various ideals, such as equality of opportunity or poverty alleviation, and can be directly used to evaluate the social acceptability of reforms. We find that the average welfare weights of the general population are progressive, indicating a desire for additional redistribution beyond that achieve by the current tax and transfer system. We find that the general population welfare weights are more progressive than the weights implied by tax and transfer policies in the U.S. but less progressive than the weights frequently used in the optimal policy literature.
