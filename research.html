        Tagging—the conditioning of taxes on income and personal characteristics correlated with earning ability—can improve efficiency. However, its social acceptability remains uncertain, as it may conflict with horizontal equity, the principle that "equals" should be treated equally. We study citizens' support for tagging in an online vignette experiment with the U.S. general population (N=3012). Our experiment manipulates three theoretically relevant features of tags: immutability, correlation with ability, and correlation with needs. We find that tags correlated with ability and needs receive higher support, consistent with the prescriptions from optimal tax theory, while immutability does not significantly predict support, contrasting the prescriptions from theory. Fairness concerns are the strongest predictors of support across treatments and individuals, while concerns about efficiency, scope of government, and implementation play a smaller role. Finally, we synthesize insights from theory, our experiment, and practice.

        Evaluating the desirability of a reform typically involves weighing the gains of winners against the losses of losers using welfare weights, which measure the value that society places on a $1 increase in an individual's consumption. They can capture various normative ideals like utilitarianism and equality of opportunity. We elicit the welfare weights of the U.S. general population using experiments and show their robustness, validity, and temporal stability. We estimate an income elasticity of welfare weights between -0.78 and -0.70, which is roughly 5-9 times more progressive than the weights implied by U.S. tax and transfer policies. The optimal marginal tax rates based on our estimates of welfare weights are 28-30 percentage points higher, on average, than the current tax rates in the U.S.
