          While tagging---the conditioning of taxes on personal characteristics correlated with earning ability---can improve efficiency, it is believed to lack political support because it violates horizontal equity (equal treatment of equals). Using an online vignette experiment with a U.S. general population sample ($N=3{,}012$), we report three results that challenge this view. First, support for tagging varies substantially across tags and individuals. Consistent with theoretical prescriptions, it is higher for characteristics with a strong correlation with ability or reflecting needs. However, the immutability of a tag does not predict support, contrary to theory. Second, variation in support reflects both horizontal and vertical equity concerns. Third, other considerations, such as efficiency and scope of government, also matter, though less so. Incorporating fairness into a model of tagging can either limit or amplify tagging relative to a canonical utilitarian benchmark. Finally, we compare our results with the tags used in the U.S. tax code and those discussed in the literature.

        Evaluating the desirability of a reform typically involves weighing the gains of winners against the losses of losers using welfare weights, which measure the value that society places on a $1 increase in an individual's consumption. They can capture various normative ideals like utilitarianism and equality of opportunity. We elicit the welfare weights of the U.S. general population using experiments and show their robustness, validity, and temporal stability. We estimate an income elasticity of welfare weights between -0.78 and -0.70, which is roughly 5-9 times more progressive than the weights implied by U.S. tax and transfer policies. The optimal marginal tax rates based on our estimates of welfare weights are 28-30 percentage points higher, on average, than the current tax rates in the U.S.
